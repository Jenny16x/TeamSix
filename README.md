<br>

## Reasoning
We selected this topic because ______.
<br>

## Data Sources
We will be using MLB pitching statistics and salary data for years 2016-2019 to train our model. We chose to use multiple years of data to imporove our model's accuracy. We chose not to include more recent years (2020 & 2021) because of the signinficant impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on professional sports. 

We sourced our pitching statistics data from _______ and our pitcher salary data from _____ ***(insert links to sources)***
<br>


## What We Plan to Answer with Data
We hope to be able to find pitcher metrics that are strongly correlated with salary in order to predict what a pitcher's salary is expected to be in the future.

# Communication Protocol
Our team will communicate during class sessions and through our own project group Slack channel. Additionally, we will be meeting once a week outside of class to discuss progress, help each other, and ensure all segment deliverables are ready for submission by Sunday evening.
