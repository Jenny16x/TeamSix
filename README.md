# Predicting Pitcher Salaries

## Purpose
The purpose of this final project is to use machine lesrning techniques to analyze a large set of data. The data will also be stored in a dataframe and database. And there will be an interactive way of displaying the data that connects to the database. There will also be a presentation.

## Topic
We have chosen to analyze pitcher statistics and their salaries to see if a key set of stats/attributes can reliably predict a pitcher's salary. 

## Analysis
Varuous regression and machine learning models will be used to analyze historical data to then be used for prediction analysis to determine salary based on key attributes.

## Conclusion
The anticpated conclusion is we will have 10-15 careogries that can be used to accurarely predict a pitcher's future salary.
