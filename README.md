# TeamSix

To better analyze the pitcher salary data, we needed to first combine and clean the data files we had. In order to attain all of the neccessary information for the analysis, we used three seperate CSV files - 1) Salaries 2) People & 3) Pitchers. The "Salaries.csv" file contained salary data for all players in the league, while the "Peoples.csv" containted their names and personal information, and the "Pitchers.csv" file contained stats for the pitchers.
