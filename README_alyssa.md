# Predicting Pitcher Salaries
## Topic
For this project, we will be creating a supervised machine learning model to take in MLB pitcher statistics to predict their expected salaries in the future.

## Reasoning
We selected this topic because ______.

## Data Sources
We will be using MLB pitching statistics and salary data for years 2016-2019 to train our model. We chose to use multiple years of data to imporove our model's accuracy. We chose not to include more recent years (2020 & 2021) because of the signinficant impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on professional sports. 

We sourced our pitching data from _______ and our salary data from _____ ***(insert links to sources)***

## What We Plan to Answer with Data
We hope to be able to find pitcher metrics that are strongly correlated with salary in order to predict what a pitcher's salary is expected to be in the future.
