# Polynomial Regression Analysis

I performed a polynomial regression anlaysis on the data after finding this online. I chose this type of model because I thought it might perform better than a normal linear regression model given that many of the stats analyzed were moderately correltated with player salary. The polynomial regression model attempted to overcome this by adding a curvature to what would otherwise be a flat prediction line. Different degrees to the model resulted in different predicted outcomes. However, I read that outliers could potentially have large effects on the results which is something to be aware of regarding the model's limitations. Currently, I've applied the polynomial regression model on "ERA" (earned run average) and "Strike Outs".
