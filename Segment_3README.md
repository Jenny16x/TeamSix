## Predicting Pitcher Salaries
### The Machine Learning Model - Updated Random Forest
The random forest model was updated with our current data set of 1990-2019 data.  Previously, the model had an accuracy score of 52.6%.  Once the new data set was uploaded, the accuracy score improved to 62.7%

### The Machine Learning Model - Updated Random Forest - Binned Age and Salaries
In addition to updating the random forest model with the new data set, an attempt was made to improve the accuracy score by also binning the ages.  Unfortunately, this did not improve the score and produced a less accurate result.
